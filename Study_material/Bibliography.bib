abstract = {This dissertation introduces an approach to effectively model and analyze the coupled nonlinear aeroelasticity and flight dynamics of highly flexible aircraft. A reduced-order, nonlinear, strain-based finite element framework is used, which is capable of assessing the fundamental impact of structural nonlinear effects in preliminary vehicle design and control synthesis. The cross-sectional stiffness and inertia properties of the wings are calculated along the wing span, and then incorporated into the one-dimensional nonlinear beam formulation. Finite-state unsteady subsonic aerodynamics is used to compute airloads along lifting surfaces. Flight dynamic equations are then introduced to complete the aeroelastic/flight dynamic system equations of motion. Instead of merely considering the flexibility of the wings, the current work allows all members of the vehicle to be flexible. Due to their characteristics of being slender structures, the wings, tail, and fuselage of highly flexible aircraft can be modeled as beams undergoing three dimensional displacements and rotations. New kinematic relationships are developed to handle the split beam systems, such that fully flexible vehicles can be effectively modeled within the existing framework. Different aircraft configurations are modeled and studied, including Single-Wing, Joined-Wing, Blended-Wing-Body, and Flying-Wing configurations. The Lagrange Multiplier Method is applied to model the nodal displacement constraints at the joint locations. Based on the proposed models, roll response and stability studies are conducted on fully flexible and rigidized models. The impacts of the flexibility of different vehicle members on flutter with rigid body motion constraints, flutter in free flight condition, and roll maneuver performance are presented. Also, the static stability of the compressive member of the Joined-Wing configuration is studied. A spatially-distributed discrete gust model is incorporated into the time simulation of the framework. Gust responses of the Flying-Wing configuration subject to stall effects are investigated. A bilinear torsional stiffness model is introduced to study the skin wrinkling due to large bending curvature of the Flying-Wing. The numerical studies illustrate the improvements of the existing reduced-order formulation with new capabilities of both structural modeling and coupled aeroelastic and flight dynamic analysis of fully flexible aircraft.},

@book{Wright2015,
abstract = {Introduction to Aircraft Aeroelasticity and Loads, Second Edition is an updated new edition offering comprehensive coverage of the main principles of aircraft aeroelasticity and loads. For ease of reference, the book is divided into three parts and begins by reviewing the underlying disciplines of vibrations, aerodynamics, loads and control, and then goes on to describe simplified models to illustrate aeroelastic behaviour and aircraft response and loads for the flexible aircraft before introducing some more advanced methodologies. Finally, it explains how industrial certification requirements for aeroelasticity and loads may be met and relates these to the earlier theoretical approaches used. Key features of this new edition include: Uses a unified simple aeroelastic model throughout the book. Major revisions to chapters on aeroelasticity. Updates and reorganisation of chapters involving Finite Elements. Some reorganisation of loads material. Updates on certification requirements. Accompanied by a website containing a solutions manual, and MATLAB{\textregistered} and SIMULINK{\textregistered} programs that relate to the models used. For instructors who recommend this textbook, a series of lecture slides are also available. Introduction to Aircraft Aeroelasticity and Loads, Second Edition is a must-have reference for researchers and practitioners working in the aeroelasticity and loads fields, and is also an excellent textbook for senior undergraduate and graduate students in aerospace engineering.},

@article{VanSchoor1989,
abstract = {This paper describes the aeroelastic analysis performed on a human-powered aircraft. The unique structural characteristics of this aircraft, namely; very flexible wings, high aspect ratio and low wing loadings, are typical of proposed high altitude long endurance aircraft. Because of these unique features, the aircraft exhibits uncommon aeroelastic characteristics. The structural dynamics of the airplane was obtained from a finite element model of the aircraft. In an assumed mode approach, a sub-set of the the natural mode shapes were used to calculate the quasi-steady and unsteady generalized modal forces using a two-dimensional strip model, which included unsteady drag and leading edge suction forces. The aeroelastic model predicted the airplane to be stable (at both sea level and high altitude), except for a mildly unstable phugoid mode. The results concluded that unsteady aerodynamics are significant for these type of aircraft and that the flexibility of the aircraft must be include to correctly model the dynamics for control purposes. A final conclusion was that the dynamics of the aircraft are very de},

@article{Kirsch2020,
abstract = {This paper presents the development of a code, called GEBTAero, dedicated to very flexible aircraft (VFA) aeroelasticity and especially the evaluation of aeroelastic tailoring effect on critical speeds. GEBTAero is an open source code consisting in a tightly coupling between a geometrically exact beam theory -and a finite state induced flow unsteady aerodynamic model, including an homogenisation tool. This model has been implemented in Fortran using GEBT code and optimised open source libraries with particular focus on computation speed. Besides a non linear transient dynamic simulation capacity, a particular focus is put on the fast critical speed computation strategy using a non-iterative modal approach about the geometrically non linear deformed shape of the wing with the computation of only a few aeroelastic modes. Computation speed and accuracy of this implementation is assessed using widely used aeroelastic test cases and compared successfully to other aeroelastic codes. Configurations using aeroelastic tailoring, which are the core target of this solver, are then evaluated numerically on a representative high aspect ratio anisotropic composite wing and a simple 2-ply composite laminates with both variable ply orientations. It illustrates the strong correlation between the structural bending/twisting coupling of an unbalanced composite laminates and its critical aeroelastic speed. It also shows the high sensitivity of ply orientation on the aeroelastic behaviour.},

@article{Guo2005,
abstract = {This paper is aimed at investigating aeroelastic tailoring of composite wing structures for maximum flutter speed by using different optimization methods. A gradient-based deterministic method (GBDM) and genetic algorithm (GA) have been employed in the investigation. It has been noted from previous research that a significant increase in flutter speed can be achieved by tailoring the fiber orientations of a composite wing box structure using the former method. However the solution largely depends upon the initial laminate lay-up. The current investigation shows that the optimized solution from GA is much less dependent upon the starting lay-up. It is much more robust in searching an optimization solution although more computing time is normally required and a global solution is not guaranteed. Sensitivity of flutter speed to optimized lay-ups has been considered when employing GA. A filter and local search algorithm has been introduced into the GA optimization to assess and identify a feasible solution from the optimized lay-ups. A uniform and a tapered composite wing structure of different swept angles have been considered for demonstration purpose in this paper. The results show that by using the two different optimization methods, same level of flutter speed increment but slightly different optimized lay-ups for the wing structures have been achieved.
